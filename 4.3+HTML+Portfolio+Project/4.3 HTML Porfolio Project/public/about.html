<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have done many different type of jobs but the I enjoy most is coding. I like seeing how the coding seems to create something different on the webpage.
  So far all I have created is html and CSS websites but I look forward to creating more and becoming a full stack developer. I plan on learning how to create AI's and seeing
  how that will work. I want to keep practicing and practicing enjoying hobby.
